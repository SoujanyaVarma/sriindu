It gives me joy unspeakable to affirm that Sri Indu group of institutions, having completed 39 years successfully, has grown into one of the best institutions in the one of the leading Groups in Hyderabad, Telangana. Our Institute is an Autonomous Institutions under UGC, Recognized under 2(f) and 12(B) of UGC Act 1956, approved by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), NBA Accredited, NAAC in pipeline and An ISO 9001 : 2000 Certified College and Permanently Affiliated to <br>

As everyone is aware of the fact that there is unprecedented advancement in the academic research and industry. Without an iota of doubt, it is to be admitted that the field of engineering and technology has undergone radical changes. That the sound engineering education is synonymous with a better standard of living has become a catchy adage of the day. Besides the acquisition of technical skills, the need of getting oneself familiarized with soft skills like communication skills, organizational skills, crisis management skills, public relations skills, etc., has gained appreciable.<br>

I am quite sure that Sri Indu is not only getting the students prepared for the potential job market but also instilling in them much needed enthusiasm even to work for the nation to meet the social aspirations of our country. I strongly believe that the engineers of today, by their innovation ideas, with their problem-solving attitude and of course, with the humanitarian bent of mind, can establish a better world where people of all nations may live in harmony and peace. By and large, I express my deep sense of commitment for the overall developments of the student community of my institute.<br>

It is my personal observation that the students are perhaps at the most difficult crossroads of their life after their intermediate examinations. The decision they make at this juncture is going to have a long lasting impact on their future life and career. A competent, qualified, experienced and responsible head of the institute can only operate with a vision towards development of an institution.<br>
It is an much instrumental as the engine of train. Our well-equipped laboratories such as laboratories with the computers having high-end configuration, the internet facility, Wi-fi enabled Campus state of the art library with national and international journals and magazines certainly create a congenial ambience for an ideal engineer in the making to grow.<br>
I am really happy that despite slowdown of economy, Sri Indu has succeeded in bringing various good companies to its campus for placements. All in all, more than 589 students have been placed through campus placements till date during the academic year 2017-18.<br>
